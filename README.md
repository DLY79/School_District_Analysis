### School District Analysis ### 

# Overview #    
The school board feels that there is academic dishonesty happening in the results of our previous analysis, specifically in the grades of 9th graders of Thomas High School.  We have been easked to replace those grades with NaN and re-present the data without those grades to give a more accurate depiction of grades.
# Results  
How is the district summary affected?  

 In both outcomes, we looked at the same number of students however in the amended outcome, the grades of THS grade 9's were replaced with NaN's.  There were only 461 grades that were affected, so the change was very minor.

How is the school summary affected?  How does replacing the ninth graders’ math and reading scores affect Thomas High School’s performance relative to the other schools?  

Since we suspected the grade 9's to be cheating, the expectation was that the overall number would be skewed.  My hypothesis was that once we removed the Grade 9 results, Thomas High School would fall in rankings.  However, removing the grades made a very minute change in the outcome.  Thomas High School remains in 2nd ranking for Overall Passing %.

Summary: Summarize four changes in the updated school district analysis after reading and math scores for the ninth grade at Thomas High School have been replaced with NaNs.

The results of the amended data was largely insignificant.  The average scores went down slightly, for both math and reading, and as a result, the overall %.
